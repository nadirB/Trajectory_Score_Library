# Trajectory_Score_Library

Trajectory Score Library is an Antescofo library of scripts, converting mathematical parametric functions into curves in order to control audio sources' trajectories. These scripts are written in the Antescofo language, a timed synchronous language which allows the use of relative time to synchronize the trajectories with musical events. This language can also provide a convenient way of creating and transmitting automation parameters through the Open Sound Control protocol implemented in Antescofo. Trajectory Score Library aims to use Max or Pure Data as a unified real-time environment to unite different computer music processes.

The MaxMsp and Pure Data folders are just demo patchs. Use the data your own way.

The library is now ported to control the external spatial engine SpatGris3 :
